# Cyber Sifu
A extensible workflow for security scanning that can be used by bug hunters and compliance folks. 

## Problem Statement
Most low hanging fruit are found in bug bounty programs by bug hunters and researchers. The goal of this project is to layout a workflow that can consume a scopelist and look for specific vulnerabilities at scale. It can also be configured to do compliance scans if that's what you're in for.  

## Design Principles
- Use as few languages as possible
- One tool per container
- Integrate with scanning pipelines


## Quick Start

## Architecture

## Future Plans
Primary goals for this project are as follows:
- Create a port scanner
- Create a DNS takeover scanner
- Create a web scanner

## Why the name?
Sifu was a video game that came out recently about a martial artist that goes on a quest for revenge. Each time the player loses, the player's avatar in the game physically ages and adapts with new techniques. The idea is that the workflow will gain new tricks (i.e., new tools) over time and improve in it's mission.
